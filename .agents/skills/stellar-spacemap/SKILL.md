name: stellar-spacemap
description: >-
  Authors evidence-driven architecture backlog docs (coming-next style): scorecards,
  mermaid diagrams, blueprint cards SN-*, thrive vision, gantt order. Use when
  creating or updating roadmaps, spacemaps, arch-design/coming-next.md, backlog
  after PRs, or when the user wants blueprint cards, Musk 5-step, or optimistic
  10-year plans. Formerly stellar-roadmap. Pairs with ai-optimization, fusion-sage,
  and higher-order-decision-architect. Triggers: stellar-spacemap, stellar-roadmap,
  coming-next, SN-*, blueprint cards.

# Stellar Spacemap — Architecture Backlog Blueprint

> **Load rule:** Formal SoT (section map + card contract). Full template → [references/document-template.md](references/document-template.md) only if drafting a new § block.  
> **Rename:** formerly `stellar-roadmap` — same contract.

```text
// Mission
SpaceMapDoc ≔ scorecards + mermaid + SN-* blueprint cards + thrive + gantt
// evidence columns mandatory; thrive ≻ funeral framing

// Axioms
A1  Tables/diagrams ≻ prose walls
A2  Every scorecard row has Evidence (file|test|metric)
A3  Pre-mortem → guardrails (refuse vs build) — not closing defeat
A4  SN-1 dogfood gate before feature cards
A5  Compose: scout([ai-optimization](../ai-optimization/SKILL.md)) → decide([higher-order-decision-architect](../higher-order-decision-architect/SKILL.md)) → synthesize([fusion-sage](../fusion-sage/SKILL.md)) → write(this)
```

**Provenance pattern:** [examples/shell-kernel.md](examples/shell-kernel.md).

---

## When to use

- Create or refresh `coming-next.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, or `arch-design/*` backlog
- After a large PR: split **done log** vs **next blueprint cards**
- User asks for: blueprint cards, scorecard, thrive vision, SN-* items, gantt sprint order
- User attaches `/ai-optimization` `/fusion-sage` `/higher-order-decision-architect` for roadmap work

**Do not use for:** single-file bug fixes, code-only tasks, or pessimistic "this feature will die" post-mortems without a thrive north star.

---

## Companion skills (load together)

| Skill | Role in this workflow |
|-------|------------------------|
| [ai-optimization](../ai-optimization/SKILL.md) | Hierarchy first; compress scout; tables > prose; never drop evidence columns |
| [fusion-sage](../fusion-sage/SKILL.md) | Fused abstraction (1 diagram); surplus item at end; binding energy on backlog items |
| [higher-order-decision-architect](../higher-order-decision-architect/SKILL.md) | Consequence chain table; guardrails not funeral; confidence % on thrive bets |

**Internal order:** scout (Context Sage) → decide (HODA) → synthesize (Fusion) → **write doc** (this skill).

---

## Tone rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Thrive, not survive** — platform shifts are cosmic weather you punch through; bottlenecks are judgment/trust, not typing.
2. **Evidence columns** — every scorecard row: Grade | One line | **Evidence** (file, test, metric).
3. **Short Orwellian English** — one idea per line; no hedge walls.
4. **Metaphor tier** — default **spacecraft** (ship computer, command bridge, hull, launch). User may say "plain" to drop metaphor.
5. **Risk ≠ defeat** — pre-mortem becomes **trajectory guardrails** (refuse vs build toward 2036). No "optional workflow that may die" framing for core product pillars the user cares about.
6. **Plain rule** — one closing sentence at footer; memorable, actionable.

## Mandatory workflow

### 1. Intake (ask only if missing)

| Input | Required |
|-------|----------|
| Target file path | Yes |
| Mission (one sentence) | Yes |
| What shipped (PR / commits) | Yes |
| Thrive picture (3–5 year horizon) | Yes |
| Backlog items (raw bullets OK) | Yes |
| Metaphor tier | Default spacecraft |

### 2. Structure (13 sections)

Use [references/document-template.md](references/document-template.md). For **scout**, load a repo-type overlay first: [examples/](examples/README.md) (`shell-kernel`, `eve-agent`) — expand full `coming-next.md` only for cards being edited.

Section map:

| § | Purpose |
|---|---------|
| 0 | Mission one sentence |
| 0b | Ten-year thrive picture (mermaid + table) |
| 1 | Scorecard shipped vs open |
| 2 | System map today |
| 3 | Precedence / data-flow (if applicable) |
| 4 | Musk 5-step on backlog |
| 5 | Trajectory forces (not "why we'll fail") |
| 6 | Guardrails refuse vs build |
| 7 | Blueprint cards SN-* |
| 8 | Scope lock (user decisions) |
| 9 | Gantt sprint order |
| 10 | Monitoring signals |
| 11 | Done log |
| 12 | File touch mindmap |
| 13 | References |

### 3. Blueprint card format (batch-2 style)

Each card **must** include:

```markdown
### SN-N · Title (verb-first)

**Problem:** One line.

```mermaid
[flow | sequence | state — pick one]
```

| File | Work |
|------|------|
| path | action |

**Done when:** Observable pass condition.

**Verify:** Commands or dogfood steps.
```

Priority: **SN-1 dogfood gate** (no new code) before feature cards.

### 4. Mermaid guardrails

- No spaces in node IDs (use camelCase)
- Subgraph titles in quotes if they contain special chars
- Prefer `flowchart` / `sequenceDiagram` / `stateDiagram-v2` / `gantt` / `mindmap`

### 5. Fusion pass before write

One fused abstraction in §0b or §2, e.g.:

> Kernel (ship computer) + Bridge (verification) + PLUGIN (hull bays) → host-agnostic manifest

Trace to ≥2 real paths in the repo.

### 6. Close with surplus

End agent reply (not necessarily the doc) with one **⚡ Fusion Surplus** line: backlog item or invariant that saves future roadmap tokens.

## External style sources (§13 pattern)

Always include a **References** table linking:

| Source | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Project boundary doc | e.g. PLUGIN.md |
| Risk / depth analysis | optional; thrive §0b is north star |
| collab-finder [intuitive-shell-plan](https://github.com/p10ns11y/collab-finder/blob/main/reports/intuitive-shell-plan.md) | Blueprint cards |
| collab-finder [batch-2-blueprints](https://github.com/p10ns11y/collab-finder/blob/main/reports/batch-2-engineering-blueprints.md) | Scorecard, gantt, done-when |
| collab-finder [single-pr-intuitive-product](https://github.com/p10ns11y/collab-finder/blob/main/reports/single-pr-intuitive-product.md) | Musk 5-step, 2nd/3rd order |
